🛠️ Kuper Tools
Extend Kubernetes. Empower Platform Engineers. Built with Go.

Welcome to Kuper Tools — a collection of purpose-built tools, controllers, operators, and admission plugins written in Go to extend Kubernetes capabilities and solve real-world platform engineering challenges.

🚀 Why Kuper Tools?
Modern platform engineering demands more than vanilla Kubernetes.

From automating governance to enforcing security policies, scaling developer platforms to customizing controllers — Kubernetes extensibility is key.

Kuper Tools enables:

Seamless Kubernetes extension using idiomatic Go

Practical solutions for internal developer platforms (IDPs)

Production-grade patterns for GitOps, policy enforcement, automation, and more

🔧 What You'll Find Here
Each repository in the org solves a specific problem with a focused and minimal Go-based Kubernetes extension.

✅ Kubernetes Operators
✅ Admission Controllers
✅ Webhooks
✅ Custom Controllers
✅ CLI tools for automation
✅ GitOps tools & platform plumbing utilities
