# Kupher Tools
# 🚀 Extend Kubernetes. Empower Platform Engineers. Built with Go.

**Welcome to Kupher Tools** — a growing suite of lightweight tools, controllers, operators, and admission plugins written in idiomatic Go to extend Kubernetes for real-world platform engineering use cases.

> **What is Kupher?**  
> Kupher = Kubernetes + Gopher 🐹  
> Think of it as “Kubernetes by Gophers, for Platform Engineers.”

## 🧩 Why Kupher Tools?

Modern platform engineering needs more than vanilla Kubernetes.

You need to **automate governance**, **enforce security policies**, and **customize controllers** to scale internal developer platforms (IDPs). Kupher helps you do just that — the Go way.

Kupher Tools aims to provide:

- 🛠️ **Modular, production-grade Kubernetes extensions** in Go  
- 🔐 **Policy enforcement & automation** via admission controllers and webhooks  
- ⚙️ **Practical utilities** for GitOps, security, developer experience, and more
